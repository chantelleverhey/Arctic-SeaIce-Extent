# Sentinel 2 - Mapping Pond Inlet Use-case
This walkthrough was a demonstration of reuse of an existing jupyter notebook from Eurodata Cube 'USING SENTINEL HUB PYTHON PACKAGE IN EDC: A STARTER'S GUIDE' repurposed for a usecase in Pond Inlet, Baffin bay, Nunavut, Canada
https://eurodatacube.com/notebooks

Throughout the repurposing of the notebook - I made adjustments to the bounding box to target a sample location of interest (Pond Inlet, Nunavut, Canada). I also adjusted the dates to retrieve sample dates for my area of interest, targeting May of 2018-2023 to look at the variances of sea-ice breakup.
